# Rhythm - Web Dev II - Portfolio

## Project Explanation
I started with the design I did in Ux Design I class using Figma. For This project I used Bootstrap. Firstly I created a repository in my github account and clone it to my vs code. Then I created my three html pages home, about, contact. Afterthat I added Images section in which I put My Images That I am going to use. Then I create Mockup folder in which I put My Hi-fi and Lo-fi of the website. Afterthat I added basic html format to all three page. Then I added my header, which I took from Bootstarp and did some changes to it. Afterthat reviewing my hi-fi from UX design, I added all the content and Images to all three pages. Then I added footer to all three pages in which I basically added footer line and social media icon with their links. Finally I added my own css in which I change colors to my own desire and also changed the font. At last I sync all my work to github and Finally I am done with My Project :joy:
