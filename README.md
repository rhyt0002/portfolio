# Rhythm - Web Dev II - Portfolio

## Project Explanation
I started with the design I did in UX Design In class using Figma. For This project I used Bootstrap. Firstly I created a repository in my GitHub account and cloned it to my vs code. Then I created my three HTML pages home, about, and contact. After that, I added the Images section in which I put the images That I am going to use. Then I create a Mockup folder in which I put My Hi-fi and Lo-fi of the website. After that, I added basic html format to all three pages. Then I added my header, which I took from Bootstrap, and made some changes to it. After reviewing my hi-fi from UX design, I added all the content and Images to all three pages. Then I added a footer to all three pages in which I added a footer line and social media icon with their links. Finally, I added my own CSS in which I changed colors to my desire and also changed the font. At last, I synced all my work to GitHub and Finally, I am done with My Project :joy:
